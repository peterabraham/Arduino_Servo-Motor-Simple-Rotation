# Arduino_Servo-Motor-Simple-Rotation
An illustrative program to rotate a servo motor using an Arduino from 0 to 180 degree and then back to 0 degree. For the servo motor the Arduino IDE contains a library the abstracted all the servo related functionalities. Servo motor is usually connected with the dedicated PWM pins of Arduino for input pulse.
